            <h3>Learning How to Learn</h3>
            <p>Why, after twelve years of schooling, do so few college students
                <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/09/14/a-telling-experiment-reveals-a-big-problem-among-college-students-they-dont-know-how-to-study/?utm_term=.0c57f8f66800'>
                    know how to study</a>?</p>
            <p>Nowhere in my K-12 education (and even throughout four years of college) did anyone clearly teach me <em>how to learn</em>.<br>
                The role of a teacher should be to give students the tools for self improvement.<br>
                As I continue to improve my own learning process I try to to help other people improve their's.<br>
                The ability to learn efficiently is the most valuable skill anyone can have.

        <section id='experience'>
            <p>In 2015 I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a major in math, a minor in science and mathematics education, and a minor in music.
                On Staff Developent days I participated in workshops for math educators and I've attended Board of Education meetings out of curiosity about our education system.
                As a college graduate I spent the 2016 and 2017 school years as a substitute teacher for the San Ramon Valley Unified School District.
                In the afternoons I tutored over twenty middle school and high school students in math.

        <section id='process'>
            <p>The first step is to clarify our goals and assess the student's grasp of the subject.
                The main goal is typically to raise a student's grade a certain amount.
                The assessment will be ongoing, as gaps in knowledge reveal themselves over time.
                Over the past two years I've become familiar with some of the most common pitfalls, and I'll test for those early on.
                Almost without fail, difficulty with advanced concepts results from incomplete understanding of more basic mathematical concepts.
                Math builds progressively.
            </p>
            <p>With a clear start and end point, we then identify good study habits to utilize, and bad ones to avoid.
                Over the course of our time together I look forward to getting feedback from students on how I can better help them learn.

        <section id='expectations'>
            <p>Students must study outside of tutoring. In the past some students have waited to start their homework when we begin our tutoring session.
                Only by independently attempting challenging problems can someone test their understanding.
                Tutoring sessions are best spent clarifying concepts that remain unclear <em>after</em> students have already tried to find a solution on their own.
                I do my best to be a great resource, but education is ultimately a process of self-improvement.
